NAME SpaceCadet interrupt SpaceCadet with hold

# First, press left shift. It takes effect immediately, because SpaceCadet is in
# "no-delay" mode.
RUN 4 ms
PRESS LSHIFT
RUN 1 cycle

# takes effect without delay.
RUN 4 ms
PRESS RSHIFT
RUN 1 cycle
EXPECT keyboard-report Key_LeftShift Key_RightShift # report: { e1 e5 }

# Next, release left shift after it times out (so it's not a "tap"), but before
# the right shift times out. This does not generate a report, because the right
# shift might still become a "tap" if it's released soon enough.
RUN 10 ms

# Next, the right shift times out, resolving to its modifier state. This allows
# the left shift to be released, because the right shift can't be a "tap".

# Last, release the right shift as normal.
